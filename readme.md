## al_leprob_openai offline learning application

- This is a low-resource computing application that can be self-hosted and used largely offline (Yes, at certain points you may need to connect to the internet) for people who are in institutions or other areas where perhaps offline is required. The application's goal is to provide a basis that can be expanded or scaled as needed with relative ease.
